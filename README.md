I implemented design upgrades to the user interface of the site. Adding colors when you over over the buttons for displaying games with or without funding. I added a squid as just something fun. I also changed the layout a bit.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was just messing around with the css as it took me while to remember, how to do it since its been a while. The javascript coding and the html part were easy though. It was pretty rushed as I had other things to do the next day, and I only found out about the course near the deadline.
